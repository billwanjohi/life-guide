# Phones

## Platform

The Android and iOS platforms have converged a lot. I recommend Android,
but both have advantages and disadvantages.

### iOS advantages

*   "just works"
*   Apple Store makes for easy service calls
*   built-in full-device backup
*   simplicity of purchase decision (only 2-3 options, all decent)
*   great Apple integration
    *   iTunes music/video
    *   iMessages, (rich chat for Mac/iPhone users)
    *   Probably some other stuff I don't know about
*   OS upgrades give most new features to old phones
    *   This has fallen apart recently; iOS 7 crippled iPhone 4s
*   some of the hottest apps start here (e.g. Instagram),
    because it's easier to develop for one handset
*   better default parental controls

### iOS disadvantages

*   rigid
*   not obviously improving in recent years
*   like all Apple products, designed to lock you in
*   services like iMessage only useful for other Apple fanatics,
    and actually counterproductive when trying to reach anyone else
*   lack of a back button drives me crazy

### Android advantages

*   great Google service integration (Now, Voice, Mail, Talk, Plus, etc.)
*   extreme flexibility
    *   lots of phones with different niches
    *   can alter components of your interface,
        like you could on a laptop/desktop
*   better typing/correction
*   better voice recognition
*   MUCH better maps
    *   Google Maps app exists on iPhone,
        but other apps hook into the inferior Apple Maps
*   more positive changes in operating system in recent years than iOS
*   better app store
    *   more diverse app ecosystem
        (because the apps have fewer controls imposed on them)
    *   apps are more likely to be free
    *   much easier to find small, quality apps
    *   can trigger app installation from your computer
    *   can install apps from alternate sources if not available in official market
*   more modern, information rich interface
    *   widgets bring lots of information and interaction to your home screen
    *   Google Now "cards" are the future,
        these things know what you want to search before you start

### Android disadvantages

*   No equivalent of the Apple Store for support calls
*   Data backup is still on you to configure
*   Scumbag manufacturers that often stop caring about legacy devices
    after not very long
*   Not all devices are any good

## Devices

*   [Buy unlocked]
    (http://www.ebay.com/gds/8-Advantages-Of-Buying-An-Unlocked-Phone-/10000000177629386/g.html)
    *   This means a phone with a multi-band GSM/UMTS radio that you can
        service in multiple countries with multiple carriers
        *   Make sure it has a 1900Mhz UMTS band for international coverage
    *   The upfront cost is higher,
        but your service can be much much cheaper
    *   You can use your device much more flexibly,
        particularly when traveling
    *   There are even unlocked phones for Verizon/Sprint, by including
        both CDMA and GSM radios.
        *   Sometimes these are only unlocked outside of the US
            (i.e. AT&T/T-Mobile would not be available)
*   If possible, buy from a retail location
    *   Helpful to have a local repair option,
        particularly if you need to return your device and need a loaner

*   As the space matures, feel and fit matter more than raw features

## Network

The most important thing for your appreciation of a smartphone is to
have consistent data network quality.

There are a variety of sources of data here:

*   [JDPower](http://ratings.jdpower.com/telecom/index.htm)
    uses traditional survey techniques
*   [OpenSignal](http://opensignal.com/) crowdsources user benchmarks
*   [RootMetrics](http://ratings.jdpower.com/telecom/index.htm)
    performs their own tests

If T-Mobile or AT&T have competitive LTE service in your area, I'd
recommend choosing between those two. Since GSM is the global standard,
you'll have more phones to choose from. And interchangeable SIM cards
are great; makes service changes really easy.

## Plans

Your network and your provider don't have to be the same thing. Once
you've settled on a network, you should check out their Mobile Virtual
Network Operators (MVNOs). These are companies that repackage the same
service at an often steeply discounted price, usually prepaid.

Wikipedia maintains a [list of MVNOs]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_mobile_virtual_network_operators).
Exclude any that don't have LTE.

Compare prices, bring your own unlocked phone, and enjoy the savings.

An example from April 2014:

I've settled on the AT&T network because it currently has the best
signal in my area. If I wanted to get a subsidized (and probably locked)
device from them, I'd have to pay $80 for monthly service on a two-year
contract, and get 2GB maximum data.

By bringing my own device and pre-paying, I can cut that bill to $60 for
the same service.

By going to one of the many AT&T LTE capable MVNOs, I can cut that bill
even further. For example, Straight Talk charges $45 for 2.5 GB of LTE
service, and then unlimited data thereafter at much slower 2G speed.

That's over $800 in savings over two years, more than enough to buy even
the fanciest new device unlocked.
