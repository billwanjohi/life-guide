# Travel

*   Use vacation for travel
*   Time your vacations to be ten days long or shorter; length doesn't
    matter that much [1]
*   Do active things [1]
*   That said, relaxation is important
*   Actively plan your vacation, at least eight weeks in advance [2]
*   Space trips 12 weeks apart for max effect [2]
*   Take off Mondays over Fridays
    *   Week before trip is filled with anticipation,
        week after is mercifully short

## Planning

### Once you have dates

*   Do cursory flight/hotel/car search to determine rough cost
*   Request time off
*   Block off on calendar(s), withdraw from all other events
*   Check vaccination, medication, visa and passport requirements
    *   These things take time to fulfill, schedule them now
*   Check temperature and precipitation averages
    *   Plan purchase of necessary clothing/gear
*   Start daily language learning
    *   Recommendations in descending order: Duolingo, Rosetta, Pimsleur
*   Find books about the place you're going

### International considerations

*   Plan to stay in the same town as the airport for at least one night,
    if you're doing anything other than a resort
    *   This lets you get your bearings, get local currency, SIM card,
        etc.

### Booking flights

*   As soon as you have dates book a flight with Southwest Airlines
    *   Can always switch to another booking later
    *   Full value is refundable or transferrable to other flights,
        and prices never seem to go down
*   Maybe set up travel alerts? not sure if necessary
*   At 331 days out, check for frequent flyer redemption options
*   Three to four weeks out (or 7-8 for international),
    at midday in the mid-week, book actual flight

## Jet-lag

*   Be 100% ready [48 hours before
    departure](https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/health/jet-lag)
*   In that window, set your sleep clock to the destination time zone

## Packing

*   Create a reusable packing checklist, with everything you may need to
    bring
*   At least four days in advance, settle on set of belongings necessary
    for your particular trip
*   At least two days in advance, pack those things that you can,
    checking them off of the list
*   Reuse this list for all future trips, filtering as necessary
*   I use Microsoft Excel with auto-filters for this purpose

### General

*   Miniature power strip

### In-flight

*   Mini notepad and pen
*   Magazines/book
*   Earplugs

### International

*   Passport (and visa if necessary)
*   Yellow vaccination book
*   Paper with destination address, return flight info (phones not allowed in immigration area)
*   Pen for customs/immigration
*   Cash entry/exit fee for immigration
*   ATM-fee rebating debit card (e.g. Fidelity, Schwab, Ally)
*   Foreign transaction-fee free credit card (e.g. Capital One)
*   Wallet that's tall enough for other currencies
*   Unlocked GSM/UMTS smartphone (e.g. Nexus 4)
*   Collapsible bag for purchases
*   External USB battery pack
*   Power adaptor

### Roughing it

*   Iodine
*   Headlamp

## Prepping tech

*   Configure and test Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/USB tethering software
*   Download current exchange rates
*   Download language dictionaries
*   Download audio and e-books

## Jamaica

*   Like most of the developing world, bargaining, begging,
    and hustling are all at play
*   Compared to a lot of other places, this is all relatively low-key
    (at least in Montego Bay / Ocho Rios)

### Transportation

*   Montego Bay airport taxi stand will fleece you
*   Skip the car rental, maybe consider hiring a driver
*   Knutsford Express is a decent option for long-haul, but know how to
    get from there to downtown
*   JUTA is the most popular transport company, you'll see them
    everywhere; not sure how best to use them
*   The tour companies will quote you outrageous prices to take you
    short distances. Bargain with them, or find a local recommendation
    from your hotel
*   The best option is *route taxis*

#### Route taxis

*   These are ordinary road vehicles that have been accredited to
    participate in the main "public" transportation system in Jamaica
*   Look for a red license plate that indicates they are bonded/licensed
*   Each taxi has a specific route, which should be painted on its side.
*   Prices are fixed; usually 100-200 JMD per person per leg
    *   Many of the fares are actually posted online, but we found the
        drivers to be quite honest.
*   Hail the cars by raising your hand, indicating the number of
    passengers. If they have room, they'll stop for you.
*   You will be asked to "small up" to make room for more; this is not a
    luxury experience, you will get to know your neighbors
*   If you need to get to the other side of town, you'll often end up
    taking two route taxis, like you would with a hub and spoke public
    transportation system
*   There's always another route taxi around the corner, so this is a
    very convenient means of transportation

### Money

*   Airport ATM has only USD
*   Always pay in local currency if possible; prices are often much
    lower
*   Accumulate smaller change, will help you in bargaining
*   Always know prices in advance, even hole in the wall can be quite
    expensive
*   Purchasing Power Parity suggest that things on average should
    be about 2/3 as expensive as in the United States (2010?)

### Telecom

*   Buy a digicel SIM card in town
    *   Will need ID
*   The 7-day data plan gives 1 GB data download for the period, and
    decent coverage
