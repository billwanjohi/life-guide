# Travel

*   Use vacation for travel
*   Time your vacations to be ten days long or shorter; length doesn't
    matter that much [1] 
*   Do active things [1]
*   That said, relaxation is important
*   Actively plan your vacation, at least eight weeks in advance [2]
*   Space trips 12 weeks apart for max effect [2]
*   Take off Mondays over Fridays
    *   Week before trip is filled with anticipation,
        week after is mercifully short

## Planning

### Once you have dates

*   Do cursory flight/hotel/car search to determine rough cost
*   Request time off
*   Block off on calendar(s), withdraw from all other events
*   Check vaccination, medication, visa and passport requirements
    *   These things take time to fulfill, schedule them now
*   Check temperature and precipitation averages
    *   Plan purchase of necessary clothing/gear
*   Start daily language learning
    *   Recommendations in descending order: Duolingo, Rosetta, Pimsleur
*   Find books about the place you're going

### Booking flights

*   As soon as you have dates book a flight with Southwest Airlines
    *   Can always switch to another booking later
    *   Full value is refundable or transferrable to other flights,
        and prices never seem to go down
*   Maybe set up travel alerts? not sure if necessary
*   At 331 days out, check for frequent flyer redemption options
*   Three to four weeks out (or 7-8 for international),
    at midday in the mid-week, book actual flight
