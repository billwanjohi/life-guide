# General

## Principles

*   Correlation != causation, but it's a good start
*   Wisdom of the crowd

## Goals

*   Get married (to the right person)
*   If you're a guy: have kids between 26-62 years
*   Go to church/synagogue/whatever
*   Invest in personal relationships
*   Travel
*   Keep a pet (dog?)
*   Follow passions
*   Constantly improve
*   Question things
*   Care for others

## Leisure

Pick activities that are:

*   Social
*   Physical
*   Practical
*   Challenging

Don't do these things too much:

*   Watch TV
*   Play video games
*   Idle web surfing

## Diet

*   Measure body fat percentage, waist circumference; not weight
*   Calorie counting is useful, but not all are equal
    *   Weight watchers plus points are sensible
*   Drink a glass of red wine a day
    *   other booze is less good, but fine
    *   unless you're likely to become an alcoholic
*   Moderate amount of coffee
*   Chocolate is fine
*   Dairy is fine
*   Less potatoes, red meat
*   More yogurt, nuts

## Exercise

*   Overall output doesn't matter
*   Vigorous effort matters
*   Heart rate is the best widely available measure
*   Running is good, swimming is better
*   If running, do 2-5 workouts, 6-7 mph, 10-15 miles per week

## Security

*   Have a plan to recover from any theft (wallet, computer, phone, jewelry box)
*   Use a password manager: Lastpass
*   Use two-factor authentication wherever possible
*   Encrypt your hard drives
*   Own less stuff
*   Keep (secure) backups
