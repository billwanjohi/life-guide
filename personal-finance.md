## Insurance

### Long Term Disability Income

As a young person, before you have any assets or dependents, permanent disability is your greatest liability.
Social security will not cover your costs without a drastic decrease in standard of living.

*   *Buy as much disability insurance as you qualify for, as soon as you can.*
    *   Usually max of 80% of annual income.
*   If possible, buy before you've been notified of any employee disabilty benefits

#### Features of an appropriate plan

*   Guaranteed renewable
*   Non-cancellable sounds reassuring, but may not be necessary
*   No limitations on type of disability
*   Benefits extend to retirement
*   Makes you whole when partially disabled / able to perform another job
*   Cost of Living Adjustments
*   From an AM Best approved insurer
*   A Future Purchase Option that allows for the benefit size that you would have preferred in the first place

### Life Insurance

*   Buy life insurance to cover all of your dependents and responsibilities
*   Don't buy life insurance for its investment properties (whole life)
*   Term life insurance is usually the best, with the option to convert to permanent insurance if you become uninsurable
*   Layer your life insurance terms, since your need will decrease with age
*   If possible, buy the amount you will need to build the family size that you want
    *   Or better, find a plan that gives a future purchase option.

## Spending / Saving

Saving is crucial, particularly when your are young.
It makes life easier. You are giving your older self a tremendous gift.

### Ideas

*   Live with roommates
*   Rent things temporarily instead of buying (e.g. Zipcar)
*   Spend your free time with people that aren't spendthrifts
*   Use prepaid phone services
*   Forgo cable service
*   Don't put it on the credit card if you don't have the money in the bank

### Save how Much?

There are many methods to determine how much you need to save/invest in order to maintain/attain
your desired standard of living.
I've been using ESPlanner, which is very useful

BUT, you risk putting the cart before the horse.
I recommend that you try to cut your costs as low as possible, particularly when you are young.
Challenge the conventional wisdom floating around you about what things you must own.

Don't be afraid of being too cheap.
You'll have decades to loosen up once you know what things you really value.
It's a lot harder to "tighten your waist" once you've grown accustomed to luxuries.

### How not to save

Don't scrimp on things that earn you money.
For example, don't drop out of college because the tuition is high.

## Banking

### Credit Unions

If you're eligible for any credit union memberships and there aren't any fees, maintain at least one.
They may give you better loan rates than commercial banks

### Checking Account

Recommendation: [Fidelity or Schwab](http://bolesblogs.com/2012/12/03/schwab-investment-checking-vs-fidelity-cash-management/)

#### Features to get

*   No minimum activity / balance
*   Free checks
*   Mobile check deposit
    *   Good to have a high limit for this, maybe > $5000
*   Online transfer
*   APY > 0%
*   Refunds all ATM fees (worldwide)

### Credit Cards

If you don't have problems with spending, use credit, not debit.

That way you build your credit history, and you're better protected in case of fraud.

#### Card recommendations

*   Fidelity American Express: 2% cash back to your checking account
*   Citi Forward: 5% points for restaurants, movies, music, books (including all Amazon.com purchases)
*   American Express Blue Cash Preferred: 6% points for groceries, 3% for gas
*   [Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards](http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/2013/capital-quicksilver-replaces-cash-offers-100-signup-bonus/):
    1.5% cash back, no foreign transaction fees

### Brokerages

#### Good Companies

1.  TIAA-CREF
2.  Vanguard
3.  Charles Schwab
4.  Fidelity
5.  Scottrade

#### Investment instruments

*   Index Funds, mutual funds that track an index of a specific financial market, are superior financial product, because of their simplicity and low fees
*   Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) share the advantages of index funds, but are optimized for situations where you are not buying very frequently
