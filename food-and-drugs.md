# Food and Drugs

## Diet

*   Track body fat percentage, waist circumference; not weight
    *   Aim for:
        *   25-30 kg/m^2 BMI for [lowest mortality risk]
            (http://intranet.santa.lt/thesaurus/no_crawl/BENDRI/Impact%20of%20obesity%20on%20total%20and%20cardiovascular%20mortality%E2%80%94fat%20or%20fiction.pdf)
            *   This is the "overweight" zone, paradoxically
            *   Lean mass decreases mortality risk, body fat increases it
        *   [Waist/Hip ratios]
            (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist%E2%80%93hip_ratio)
            of 0.7 for women and 0.9 for men
    *   Maintain essential fat + [whatever needed for activity of choice]
        (http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/normal-ranges-of-body-weight-and-body-fat)
*   Calorie counting is useful, but not all calories are equal
    *   Nutrients also important
    *   As is satiety of food
    *   Weight watchers plus points are sensible
    *   [DASH Diet](http://health.usnews.com/best-diet/dash-diet) is sound
    *   Don't drink your calories (alcohol notwithstanding)
    *   [Dietary fat doesn't make you fat](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/67/3/556S.short)
*   [Foods matter, not just calorie content](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1014296)
    *   Less potatoes, processed/red meat
    *   More yogurt, nuts, fruits, vegetables, whole grains
*   Eat whole, organic foods when possible

### Drinks

#### Alcohol

*   Abstinence is a health risk
*   Drink an average of
    [35g / 42g of alcohol per week](http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=769554)
    if you're a woman / man for maximum benefit
    *   14g is a "standard" American drink
    *   A pint of beer is ~23g
*   Avoid drinking until drunk
*   If you have symptoms of alcohol-use disorder,
    [seek *medical* treatment](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/the-irrationality-of-alcoholics-anonymous/386255/)
    *   Alcoholics Anonymous is likely not your best option
    *   There are many medical treatments available to help you regain
        moderation

#### Others

*   Chocolate is fine, darker the better
*   Drink
    [3-5 cups of coffee a day](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/21/its-official-americans-should-drink-more-coffee/)

### Fasting

Fasting for 72 hours may be very beneficial to people's immune systems:

## Vitamins

*   Eat whole foods, [not supplements]
    (http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/07/the-vitamin-myth-why-we-think-we-need-supplements/277947/)
    *   Even water soluble vitamins have shown to be counterproductive in supplement form
    *   [Exceptions]
        (http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/MVMS-HealthProfessional/#h3):
        *   [Vitamin D3]
            (http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/)

## Drugs

*   Learn the active ingredient and dosage of medications you take
    *   e.g. Regular Strength Tylenol is 325mg Acetaminophen
*   Look for generic equivalents or alternatives

### Pain medication

*   [Acetaminophen/Paracetamol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol)
    (Tylenol) is highly recommended because of its dearth of side effects.
    *   But, it's easy to overdose on, so you must be careful NOT to:
        *   Use more than prescribed
        *   Use with alcohol
        *   Use in more than one form
            *   e.g. Vicodin + Tylenol

### Cold and Flu

*   [WebMD]

#### Preventing

*   Wash your hands
*   Use >=60% alcohol hand sanitizer
*   Clean commonly touched surfaces
*   Get a flu shot
*   Cough into the bend of your elbow
*   Stay home when sick

#### Shortening length

Not much you can do

*   There is [some evidence]
    (http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/zinc-lozenges-cold-remedy)
    that zinc can reduce length of colds
    *   Can build up in your body, so should be taken for short periods
    *   Most effective at early stages
    *   May be particularly effective as a lozenge
*   ["Vitamin C may provide benefit for people at high risk of colds
    due to frequent exposure"]

*   ["Some studies [of echinacea] show no benefit. Others show a
    significant reduction in the severity and duration of cold symptoms
    when taken in the early stages of a cold."]

#### Easing symptoms

*   All symptoms
    *   Rest and plenty of warm fluids
    *   Chicken soup
    *   Humid air
*   Sore throat
    *   Gargle salt-water
*   Nasal irritation
    *   Topical petroleum jelly
*   Sinus Congestion
    *   Nasal irrigation with saline solution
        *   [Nasaline] syringe is an easy, effective method
        *   Neti-pots are a popular alternative
        *   Saline nasal sprays are inferior, but easiest
    *   Nasal corticosteroids (prescription-only)
    *   Pseudoephedrine is an effective decongestant
        *   Only use for a few days at most
        *   May cause rebound (worse symptoms after discontinuation)
    *   Phenylephrine (a less restricted decongestant) is questionably
        effective
*   Overactive sinuses / sleeplessness
    *   [First-generation anti-histamines]
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H1_antagonist#First-generation_.28non-selective.2C_classical.29)
        like diphenhydramine
        *   Drowsiness commonly caused by these is a feature in this case
    *   Cetirizine is a good non-drowsy alternative
*   Fever / Pain (for adults and older children)
    *   OTC analgesics can help with fever and pain,
        use whatever works for you usually
        *   e.g. Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Naproxen
